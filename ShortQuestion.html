Their electrical conductivity increases with temperature, unlike insulators and conductors.</li>
                   
                    <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Define packing fraction. What is the packing fraction for BCC?  </strong><br>Packing fraction is the ratio of the volume occupied by atoms in a crystal to the total volume of the crystal. For Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) structure, the packing fraction is approximately 0.68.</li>

                    <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Why X-rays are used for study of crystal structure and not ultraviolet radiations?</strong><br>X-rays have wavelengths comparable to the interatomic distances in crystals, making them suitable for diffraction studies, unlike ultraviolet radiations which have much shorter wavelengths.</li>

                    <li class="list-group-item"><strong>What do you understand by density of states? </strong><br>Density of states refers to the number of electronic states per unit energy interval at each energy level that are available to be occupied by electrons.</li>

                    <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Why N-type and P-type semiconductors are electrically neutral? </strong><br>N-type and P-type semiconductors are electrically neutral because the total number of positive and negative charges within the material remains balanced.</li>
