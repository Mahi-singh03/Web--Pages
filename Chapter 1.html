                <div class="accordion-body"><strong>Electron-Proton theory :</strong><br>The Electron-Proton Hypothesis of nuclear construction was an early model proposed to explain the structure of atomic nuclei before the discovery of the neutron. According to this hypothesis, the nucleus of an atom is composed of protons and electrons1. The idea was that the positive charge of the nucleus was due to protons, and the electrons were thought to be present within the nucleus to account for the neutralization of the positive charge<br><hr>
                <strong>Failures of the Hypothesis</strong><br>
                <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
                  <li class="list-group-item">1 ) Finite Size of Electrons : Electrons are spherical and have finite dimensions, making it difficult to fit a large number of them into a small nucleus, especially in heavy elements.</li>
                  <li class="list-group-item">2 ) Spin Considerations : Both protons and electrons have a spin of 
                    1
                    /
                    2
                    . According to the hypothesis, the nucleus should have half-integral spin if the number of protons and electrons is even, and integral spin if odd1. However, experimental observations showed that the spin of the nucleus depends on the mass number 
                    ùê¥
                    , with integral spin for even

                    ùê¥</li>
                  <li class="list-group-item">3 ) Magnetic Moment : The hypothesis could not explain the nuclear magnetic moment.</li>
                  <li class="list-group-item">4 ) Discovery of the Neutron : The most significant failure was the discovery of the neutron by James Chadwick in 1932. The neutron explained the missing mass and charge balance in the nucleus, leading to the proton-neutron model, which replaced the electron-proton hypothesis.</li>
