                  <strong>Nuclear Size:</strong><br>
                  The nuclear size refers to the physical dimensions of an atomic nucleus, typically calculated using the formula:<br>
                  <em>R = R‚ÇÄ A<sup>1/3</sup></em>, <br>where <em>R‚ÇÄ</em> is approximately 1.2 femtometers (fm), and <em>A</em> is the mass number. Nuclear radii are in the range of <em>10‚Åª¬π‚Åµ m</em>.<br>
                  <hr>
                  <strong>Nuclear Volume:</strong><br>
                  The nuclear volume is the space occupied by the nucleus, estimated using the formula for the volume of a sphere: <br>
                  <em>V = (4/3)œÄR¬≥</em>. Since <em>R</em> is proportional to <em>A<sup>1/3</sup></em>, the nuclear volume is directly proportional to <em>A</em>.
                  <hr>
                  <strong>Nuclear Density:</strong><br>
                  Nuclear density is the mass per unit volume of the nucleus, given by:
                  <em>Density = Mass/Volume</em>. The nuclear density is nearly constant for all nuclei, approximately <em>2.3 √ó 10¬π‚Å∑ kg/m¬≥</em>, due to the strong nuclear force.
                  <hr>
                  <strong>Wave Mechanics:</strong><br>
                  Wave mechanics is a branch of quantum mechanics describing the behavior of particles using wave properties. It is based on wave-particle duality and uses the Schr√∂dinger equation:
                  <em>ƒ§œà = Eœà</em>, where:
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>ƒ§:</strong> Hamiltonian operator (total energy)</li>
                    <li><strong>œà:</strong> Wavefunction</li>
                    <li><strong>E:</strong> Energy eigenvalue</li>
                  </ul>
                  Wave mechanics explains phenomena like electron orbitals, tunneling, and energy quantization.

                  <strong>Nuclear Forces and Meson Theory:</strong><br>
                  Nuclear forces are the strong interactions that bind protons and neutrons (nucleons) together in the nucleus. The Meson Theory, proposed by Hideki Yukawa in 1935, explains these forces as being mediated by particles called **mesons**. These mesons act as exchange particles that transmit the strong nuclear force between nucleons.
                  <br><br>
                  According to the theory:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Nucleons exchange virtual mesons, leading to an attractive force that counteracts the repulsive electrostatic force between protons.</li>
                    <li>The range of nuclear forces is determined by the mass of the mesons (\(m_\pi\)) and is short-ranged because mesons are massive compared to photons (mediators of electromagnetic forces).</li>
                  </ul>
                  The potential energy of the nuclear force between two nucleons can be represented as:
                  \[
                  V(r) = -g^2 \frac{e^{-m_\pi c r / \hbar}}{r}
                  \]
                  where:
                  <ul>
                    <li>\(g\): Coupling constant (strength of the interaction)</li>
                    <li>\(r\): Distance between nucleons</li>
                    <li>\(m_\pi\): Mass of the pion (meson)</li>
                    <li>\(c\): Speed of light</li>
                    <li>\(\hbar\): Reduced Planck constant</li>
                  </ul>
                  This equation shows that the nuclear force decreases exponentially with distance, making it effective only over a short range (~1-2 femtometers).

                  <strong>Properties of Nuclear Forces:</strong>
                  <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
                    <li class="list-group-item"><strong>1) Short Range:</strong> Nuclear forces act only over a very short distance (~1-2 femtometers). Beyond this range, the force becomes negligible.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item"><strong>2) Charge Independence:</strong> The nuclear force between two nucleons (proton-proton, neutron-neutron, or proton-neutron) is nearly the same, indicating that it is independent of charge.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item"><strong>3) Strong Nature:</strong> Nuclear forces are much stronger than electromagnetic and gravitational forces, ensuring the stability of the nucleus.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item"><strong>4) Saturation:</strong> Each nucleon interacts only with its nearest neighbors, meaning nuclear forces are saturating in nature and do not increase with the number of nucleons.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item"><strong>5) Spin Dependence:</strong> The nuclear force depends on the relative spin orientations of the nucleons, favoring parallel spins in some configurations.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item"><strong>6) Exchange Forces:</strong> Nuclear forces arise due to the exchange of mesons (e.g., pions), making them quantum mechanical in origin.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item"><strong>7) Asymmetry:</strong> The force is attractive at longer distances (1-2 fm) but can become repulsive at very short distances (<0.8 fm) to prevent nucleons from collapsing into each other.</li>
