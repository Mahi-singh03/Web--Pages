                <strong>What is saturation of nuclear forces?</strong>
                <br />
                Saturation of nuclear forces refers to the property that each nucleon (proton or neutron) in the nucleus only interacts with a limited number of nearby nucleons, not with all nucleons in the nucleus. This is due to the short-range nature of the strong nuclear force.

                <strong>Which quantity tells us the shape of nucleus?</strong>
                <br />
                The shape of the nucleus is described by the nuclear quadrupole moment. If a nucleus has a non-zero quadrupole moment, it indicates that the nucleus is not perfectly spherical.

                <br />
                ¬≤‚Å¥He, ‚Å∂¬π¬≤C, and ¬≤‚Å∞‚Å¥‚Å∞Ca are more stable because they have a balanced ratio of protons to neutrons and closed nuclear shells, which lead to greater binding energy and stability.

                <strong>If the electrons are not present inside the nucleus then how Œ≤-decay is possible?</strong>
                <br />
                In Œ≤-decay, a neutron in the nucleus decays into a proton, an electron (Œ≤-particle), and an antineutrino. The electron is created during the decay process and is not originally present inside the nucleus.

                <strong>If nuclear shell closes at magic numbers then at which numbers electrons shell closes?</strong>
                <br />
                Electron shells close at magic numbers, which correspond to the number of electrons needed to fill the shells. These numbers are 2, 10, 18, 36, 54, 86, etc.

                When ¬≥‚Å∏Li decays to ‚Å¥‚Å∏Be, it undergoes Œ≤- decay, emitting an electron and an antineutrino.

                <br />
                A nuclear reaction is exoergic if the Q-value is positive, meaning the reaction releases energy.

                <br />
                Carbon dating, also known as radiocarbon dating, is a method used to determine the age of an object containing organic material. It is based on measuring the amount of carbon-14 (¬π‚Å¥C) remaining in the object and comparing it to the known half-life of carbon-14.

                Mass defect is the difference between the mass of a nucleus and the sum of the masses of its constituent protons and neutrons. This "missing" mass is converted into binding energy that holds the nucleus together, as described by Einstein's equation \( E = mc^2 \).
