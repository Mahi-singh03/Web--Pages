              <strong>Definition of CRO:</strong> <br />A Cathode Ray
              Oscilloscope (CRO) is an electronic device used to display and
              analyze the shape of electrical signals. It helps in visualizing
              how voltage signals change over time.<br />
              <hr />
              
              <strong>Principle of CRO:</strong><br />A CRO works by directing
              an electron beam across a screen using electric fields. The beam's
              path is altered by the voltage of the input signal. When the beam
              hits the screen, it lights up, displaying the signal as a visual
              waveform.<br />

              <strong>Working of CRO:</strong><br />The CRO operates by first amplifying the input signal through the vertical amplifier and then passing it through a delay line to ensure the entire waveform is visible. The trigger circuit synchronizes the signal with the horizontal sweep generated by the time base generator, which creates a ramp voltage controlling the horizontal deflection plates. This ramp voltage is then amplified by the horizontal amplifier. Simultaneously, the vertical deflection plates adjust according to the input signal's amplitude. An electron gun emits a beam of electrons that is directed by these deflection plates to move across the phosphorescent screen of the Cathode Ray Tube (CRT). The screen lights up where the electron beam strikes, displaying the waveform of the input signal. The power supply provides necessary voltages to all components, ensuring smooth operation.<br />

              <strong>Definition of CRT:</strong> <br />A Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) is an electronic device that uses electron beams to create images on a phosphorescent screen.<br />
              <hr />
              
              <strong>Principle of CRT:</strong><br />The principle of a CRT is based on the behavior of electrons. An electron gun emits a beam of electrons, which are then directed by electric or magnetic fields. These electrons move across a phosphorescent screen, causing it to emit light upon impact. The movement of the beam and its intensity are controlled to form images.<br />

              <strong>Working of CRO:</strong><br>In a CRT, the electron gun generates an electron beam that is focused and accelerated towards the screen. The deflection plates or coils control the direction of the electron beam. When the beam strikes the phosphorescent screen, the screen glows at the point of impact, creating a spot of light. By rapidly moving the beam across the screen in a controlled manner, an image is formed. The intensity of the electron beam can be varied to change the brightness of the spots on the screen, enabling the display of different shades and contrasts.
